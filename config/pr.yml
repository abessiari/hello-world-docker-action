# Note that both of the above forms (with and without period after version number) should resolve to the
#   same file, as the extraneous trailing period stems from an error on the data-version line
#   in releases prior to 54.0

# As indicated above, PRO uses a major.minor release versioning system. However, OBO Foundry guidelines
#   specify that versioned PURLs should use a yyyy-mm-dd format. For PRO this requires special handling,
#   which is achieved by sending such requests to a special handler script called getPRO. The script
#   uses a lookup table to return a PURL of the type above. This return-a-PURL method is done so that 
#   failovers will be handled in a consistent way. Special note: the script will actually handle ANY date,
#   returning the release that was active on that date. This obviates the need for a user to know the
#   precise dates of releases, and allows us to bypass the need to create a new PURL for every release.
